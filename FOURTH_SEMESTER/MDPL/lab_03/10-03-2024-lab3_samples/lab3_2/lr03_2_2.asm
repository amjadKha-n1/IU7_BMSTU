; Defines a data segment named "DATA" using the paragraph (16-byte) addressing scheme and marks it as common.
SD1 SEGMENT para common 'DATA'
	;  Declares a byte variable labeled C1
	C1 LABEL byte
	; Sets the origin (memory offset) to 1 byte within the data segment. This affects the location of subsequent variables.

	; Certainly! In assembly language, ORG stands for "origin" and is used to set the memory offset where subsequent
	;  code or data will be assembled or located. In the provided code, ORG 1h sets the origin (memory offset) to 1 byte within the data segment SD1.
	; This is the hexadecimal value 1, indicating the memory offset where subsequent data or code will be located.
	ORG 1h
	; Declares another byte variable labeled C2.
	C2 LABEL byte
;  Marks the end of the data segment definition.
SD1 ENDS
; Defines a code segment named "CODE" using the paragraph (16-byte) addressing scheme.
CSEG SEGMENT para 'CODE'
	; Specifies segment register assumptions. It assumes that the code segment (CS) is CSEG, and the data segment (DS) is SD1.
	ASSUME CS:CSEG, DS:SD1
; Marks the beginning of the code with the label "main."
main:
	; Load the address of the data segment SD1 into the AX register and set the data segment register (DS) to that value.
	mov ax, SD1
	; The value in the AX register (which now holds the address of SD1) is moved into the data segment register DS. This sets the DS register 
	; to point to the SD1 segment, enabling access to the variables declared within it.
	mov ds, ax
	;  This instruction loads the value 2 into the AH register. In DOS interrupt calls, AH typically holds the function code for the specific 
	; action to be performed. In this case, 2 represents the function code for displaying a character on the screen.
	mov ah, 2
	; This instruction loads the value stored in the memory location labeled C1 into the DL register. Since C1 is a byte variable, it holds 
	; a single character value. Loading it into DL prepares the character to be displayed on the screen.
	mov dl, C1
	;  Generate a software interrupt (21h) to invoke a DOS function. In this case, it's function 2, which displays the character in DL.
	int 21h
	; Load the value of the byte variable C2 into the DL register. This value will be displayed on the screen
	mov dl, C2
	; Generate another interrupt to display the character in DL.
	int 21h
	;  This instruction loads the hexadecimal value 4c00h into the AX register. This value represents the DOS function code 
	; for program termination with an exit code. The exit code is stored in the AL portion of AX.
	; Set the exit code to 4c00h (indicating program termination) and generate a software interrupt (21h) to terminate the program.
	mov ax, 4c00h
	int 21h
CSEG ENDS
; Marks the end of the program, specifying the entry point as the "main" label.

; In assembly language, the content of memory locations (such as C1 and C2) depends on the assembler and linker processes. 
; When you assemble and link the code to create an executable, the assembler and linker allocate memory addresses to variables
;  and other data structures, and they might also initialize memory with certain default values.

; If, during the assembly and linking process, the memory locations for C1 and C2 are initialized with the characters 'D' and '4'
;  respectively, then these characters will be displayed when the program executes.

; For example, if the assembler/linker initializes C1 with the ASCII value of 'D' (which is 68 in decimal or 0x44 in hexadecimal) 
; and C2 with the ASCII value of '4' (which is 52 in decimal or 0x34 in hexadecimal), then during execution, the program will load 
; these values into registers and display them sequentially, resulting in the output "D4".

; This code defines a data segment (SD1) with two byte variables (C1 and C2).
; The code segment (CSEG) performs simple operations, setting up DOS function calls to
;  display the values of C1 and C2 on the screen before terminating the program.
; The actual functionality of the program is to display characters on the screen 
; using DOS interrupts. The specific characters and their positions are determined by the values of C1 and C2.
