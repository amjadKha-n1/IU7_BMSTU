; In many computer systems, especially those with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or text-based displays, there's a dedicated area
;  in the system's memory known as video memory. Video memory (also referred to as VRAM - Video Random Access Memory) is a portion
;  of memory that holds the data necessary for displaying images, text, or graphical user interfaces on a monitor or screen.
; 
; In older systems, such as those running on DOS environments mentioned in the provided code snippet, video memory was 
; particularly important for displaying text mode screens. Each character on the screen would correspond to a specific 
; location in video memory.
; 
; In the provided code snippet, 0b800h is an example of a video memory address. This specific address corresponds to the
;  beginning of video memory in the DOS environment. By specifying DS2 SEGMENT AT 0b800h, the code is setting up a data 
; segment named DS2 to start at this memory address. This indicates that any data declared within the DS2 segment will reside in video memory.
; 
; So, in essence, the 0b800h address represents the starting point of video memory, where text and other visual data are stored for 
; display on the screen in DOS environments.

; Defines a data segment named DS2 at the video memory address 0b800h. 
; Video memory is often used for text mode in DOS environments.

	; In assembly language, a byte variable is a type of variable that can hold a single byte of data, which is typically 8 bits 
	; in size. This means that a byte variable can store values ranging from 0 to 255 (2^8 - 1).
	; Declares a byte variable labeled CA.
	CA LABEL byte
	; The ORG directive (origin) specifies the offset within the segment where the subsequent data or code will be located.
	; In this case, the expression 80 * 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 calculates the offset.
	; The value 80 * 2 * 2 corresponds to 320, and 2 * 2 corresponds to 4. So, 320 + 4 = 324.
	; This sets the origin (offset) to 324 bytes from the beginning of the DS2 segment.
	; Defines a data segment named DS2 at the video memory address 0b800h. 
	; Video memory is often used for text mode in DOS environments.

	; In assembly language, an offset refers to the distance between a memory address and a reference point, such as the 
	; beginning of a data structure or code segment. It is commonly used to access specific memory locations or variables within a program.

; In summary, the output_X procedure loads the address of the DS2 segment into the ES register, moves a specific value (10) 
; into AH, loads the value of X into AL, and then stores the combined value (DS2 address and X value) into the SYMB variable 
; within the DS2 segment. Finally, it returns control back to the calling code.



; This code is also designed for a 16-bit DOS environment.
; It declares a public symbol output_X and an external byte variable X.
; It defines a data segment (DS2) in video memory, declares byte and word variables (CA and SYMB), and a code segment.
; The output_X procedure moves the address of DS2 into the extra segment (ES), sets the value 10 in the AH register, 
; moves the value of X into the AL register, stores the result in SYMB, and then returns.
; The program is minimal and does not contain a specific main routine. The functionality is dependent on how these \
; components are used in a larger program.



; In both cases, the actual purpose and functionality depend on the complete implementation of the external functions 
; (output_X in both cases) and how these modules are integrated into a larger program or system.
