; This code sets up a basic 16-bit DOS program.
; It defines a stack segment, a data segment with a byte variable X initialized to 'R', and a code segment.
; The main program (main) sets the data segment register (DS) and calls an external function output_X.
; The actual functionality of the program depends on the implementation of output_X, which is declared but not defined in this code.
; The program terminates with a DOS interrupt (21h).


; In both cases, the actual purpose and functionality depend on the complete implementation of the external functions 
; (output_X in both cases) and how these modules are integrated into a larger program or system.
