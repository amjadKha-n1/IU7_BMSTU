; This code defines a stack segment, a data segment with a single byte variable X, and a code segment 
; that performs an unconditional jump to the exit symbol.
; The actual functionality of the program depends on the implementation of the exit symbol, which is 
; declared as an external far reference. The jump to exit suggests that the program is likely intended 
; to terminate or transition to another part of the code.
; The program structure is minimal, and its behavior is determined by the external references and the 
; definition of exit in other modules or files.
