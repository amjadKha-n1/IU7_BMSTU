PUBLIC exit

SC2 SEGMENT para public 'CODE'
	; Specifies segment register assumptions. It assumes that the code segment (CS) is SC2, and the data segment (DS) is SD2.

exit:
	;  instruction loads the segment address of the variable X into the AX register. This instruction retrieves the segment part of the address of X
	mov ax, seg X
	;  instruction then sets the extra segment register ES to the value stored in AX. This establishes ES as the segment where X is located.
	mov es, ax
	; This instruction moves the byte located at memory address X within the segment ES into the BH register. It effectively 
	; loads the value stored at the memory location pointed to by X into BH..
	mov bh, es:X
	; Loads the segment address of SD2 into the AX register and sets the data segment register (DS) to that value.
	mov ax, SD2
	mov ds, ax
	; This instruction exchanges the values of the accumulator high (AH) register and the byte variable Y. 
	; It swaps the contents of AH with the value stored in Y.
	xchg ah, Y
	;  this instruction swaps the contents of AH with the byte located at the memory address X within the segment ES.
	xchg ah, ES:X
	; Exchanges the values of AH register and the variable Y.
	xchg ah, Y	
	; Sets the value 2 into the AH register. This is a DOS function code for displaying a character on the screen.
	mov ah, 2
	; Moves the value of Y into the DL register, which will be displayed on the screen.
	mov dl, Y
	;  Generates a software interrupt (21h) to invoke a DOS function. In this case, it's function 2, which displays the

; his code appears to demonstrate the interaction between different segments, involving data manipulation and a 
; DOS function call to display a character on the screen.
; The functionality is reliant on the definition of the external symbol X and the specific values of 
; variables Y and ES:X. The use of the exit label implies a termination or transition point in the program.
; ; The program structure is minimal, and its exact behavior depends on the values assigned to variables and the
;  implementation of the external symbol X.
